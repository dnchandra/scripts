Problem Statement

Windows Server management was manual, slow, and error-prone. Routine tasks such as IIS validation, service checks, patch verification, and log reviews required RDP into each server, running PowerShell commands, and manually consolidating results.
For a 10-server fleet, even basic checks consumed 8–12 hours per cycle.

Key challenges:

High manual effort: 30–100 minutes per function (IIS, services, certificates, logs, etc.).

Inconsistency: Human errors in scripting and data aggregation.

Slow response: Post-deployment and post-patching validation delayed issue detection.

Tool limitations: Splunk and Dynatrace provided monitoring, but lacked real-time, Windows-specific operational control.

Implemented Solution

To overcome these challenges, we built and deployed WinServerOps Studio, a centralized web-based dashboard with a FastAPI backend and React/Tailwind frontend. It uses secure WinRM collectors to execute PowerShell commands in parallel across multiple servers and aggregates results into a single interface with export options.

Key capabilities now in place:

Automation: All health checks and verifications are executed centrally without RDP.

Near-instant results: Most functions complete in <30 seconds.

Scalability: Heavy operations like deployment verification or disk info finish in 1–5 minutes, even on large fleets.

Unified UI: One dashboard for execution, filtering, and Excel exports.

Comprehensive coverage: IIS, services, certificates, event logs, registry, installed software, disk info, and deployment verification.

Streaming feedback: Live progress for service/IIS restarts, connectivity tests, and patch checks.

Function	Manual Effort	With Studio	Realistic Savings
IIS Websites & App Pools	~60 min	<30 sec	~59 min (99%)
Windows Services Status	~50 min	<30 sec	~49 min (99%)
OS Post-Patching Checks	~90 min	~1–2 min	~88 min (97%)
Installed Software & Hotfixes	~70 min	<1 min	~69 min (98%)
Content Verification (files)	~80 min	~1–2 min	~78 min (97%)
Registry Queries	~40 min	<30 sec	~39 min (98%)
Certificates	~60 min	<30 sec	~59 min (99%)
Event Logs	~100 min	~2–3 min	~97 min (97%)
Connectivity Testing	~30 min	<30 sec	~29 min (98%)
Service/IIS Management (Restart)	~70 min	~1 min	~69 min (98%)
Disk Information	~60 min	~2–4 min	~56 min (93%)
Deployment Verification	~120 min	~3–5 min	~115 min (95%)
Overall Savings

Earlier: ~8–12 hours for 10 servers.

Now: Seconds for most checks; 1–5 minutes for heavy tasks.

Net Gain: 95–99% faster execution, with consistent outputs and near real-time validation.
