Good morning everyone,

Today, I’ll be walking you through our in-house solution — ServerOps Studio, a unified platform built to simplify Windows server operations and significantly cut down manual effort.

Background

In our Sales & Research platform, we manage a huge infrastructure — more than 1,500 servers across 10 data centers and 41 AITs.
Traditionally, admins had to work across multiple tools — Event Viewer, IIS Manager, Services Console, Patch Manager, and Certificate Store — just to perform routine checks or troubleshooting.

This resulted in:

Fragmented workflows

Time-consuming manual checks

Delayed issue resolution, and

High skill dependency for new team members.

We realized we needed a centralized automation platform — something that could bring together all these operational tasks under a single interface.

That’s where ServerOps Studio comes in.

Technical Architecture

If you look at the architecture slide — the design is built for simplicity, speed, and scalability.

On the frontend, we used React and Tailwind, providing a modern, responsive UI for users.

The backend handles orchestration and logic.

We use WinRM-based PowerShell collectors that connect to all Windows servers to pull data on IIS, Services, Patches, Certificates, and Logs.

The results are then consolidated and exported for reporting.

We also maintain an Inventory & Config module, which stores environment details, making it easy to reuse configurations across multiple data centers.

This setup allows us to validate hundreds of servers in parallel — with a single click — eliminating the need for multiple consoles or RDP sessions.

Tool Capabilities

Now, coming to the tool itself — ServerOps Studio provides an end-to-end operational toolkit, all from one dashboard:

Server Health Info – OS version, uptime, stopped services, IIS status

Deployment Verification – file change detection, config validation, download inspection

IIS Management – website and app pool details, export options

Windows Services – service status, startup type, logon accounts

Event Log Analysis – filtered log search with export capabilities

Certificate Management – SSL expiry tracking, issuer details

Patch & Software Inventory – compliance and post-patching validation

Registry, DNS, Remote Connectivity, and GAC Tools – for advanced diagnostics and export

In short, everything an admin needs for post-deployment validation, troubleshooting, or readiness checks is available in one integrated platform.

Efficiency & Impact

Now let’s look at the real impact — how much time we’ve been able to save.

Based on actual measurements, here’s what we observed:

IIS and Services checks that earlier took 50–60 minutes now complete in under 30 seconds.

Patch validation and software inventory dropped from 70–90 minutes to 1–2 minutes.

Event log reviews, which used to take over 100 minutes, now finish in 2–3 minutes.

Even deployment verifications and registry queries now complete within seconds.

Across multiple operations, we’ve achieved efficiency gains of 50–95 minutes per 10 servers, which translates to 95–99% time reduction in repetitive operational checks.

This means tasks that earlier took 8–12 hours now finish in minutes or even seconds — giving teams back valuable engineering time for more critical work.

Summary

To summarize:

ServerOps Studio unifies server operations into a single pane of glass.

It delivers faster validation, automated monitoring, and consistent reporting.

It reduces skill dependency, enhances reliability, and improves overall operational efficiency across all AIT environments.

Moving forward, we plan to extend this framework with Linux support, API-driven integrations, and analytics dashboards to bring even deeper insights into our infrastructure.

In short, ServerOps Studio transforms the way we manage servers — from manual and fragmented to automated, scalable, and standardized.

Thank you.
