Good evening everyone,

Today, I’ll be walking you through our in-house solution — WinServerOps Studio, a unified platform built to simplify Windows server operations and significantly reduce manual effort.

In our Sales & Research platform, we manage over 1,500 servers across 10 data centers and 41 AITs.
Traditionally, APSE and Server Administrators had to use multiple tools such as Event Viewer, IIS Manager, Services Console, and Certificate Store for routine health checks, troubleshooting, post-deployment validations, ARC exercises, or data center isolation activities.

This approach led to fragmented workflows, time-consuming manual checks, delayed issue resolution, and high skill dependency for new team members.

We clearly needed a centralized automation platform to bring all these activities together — and that’s where WinServerOps Studio comes in.

Tool Capabilities

Now, coming to the tool capabilities — due to time constraints, I’ll highlight a few key features this platform provides.

WinServerOps Studio offers a single dashboard for end-to-end operational tasks, including:

Server Health Info – provides uptime, OS version, and stopped services details.

Deployment Verification – validates file changes and configurations.

IIS Management – displays website, app pool details, and advanced settings.

Windows Services & Event Logs – allows checking service status, start/stop operations, and analyzing event logs directly from the same UI.

Certificate Management – shows issuer and expiry information.

Plus, advanced tools for Registry, DNS, Remote Connectivity, and GAC assemblies.

In short, it provides everything needed for post-deployment validation, troubleshooting, and readiness checks — all in one place.

Impact & Savings

Now, let’s look at the real impact — how much time we’ve been able to save.
Based on actual measurements:

IIS and Service checks reduced from 50–60 minutes to under 30 seconds.

OS patching or NPT remediation validations dropped from 90 minutes to 1–2 minutes.

Event log reviews now take just 2–3 minutes instead of over 100 minutes.

Across multiple operations, we’ve achieved efficiency gains of 50–95 minutes per 10 servers, resulting in 95–99% faster execution.
Essentially, tasks that earlier took 8–12 hours now complete in minutes or even seconds, freeing up valuable engineering time for more strategic work.

Technical Architecture

If you look at the architecture — the design is built for simplicity, speed, and scalability.
It’s a self-serve tool, built with a React-Tailwind frontend, WinRM-based PowerShell collectors, and a scalable backend, capable of validating hundreds of servers in parallel with a single click.

Summary

To summarize — WinServerOps Studio unifies server operations into a single, automated, and scalable platform.
It enhances reliability, reduces manual effort, and standardizes operations across all AIT environments.

Going forward, we plan to extend it with Linux support and API-driven integrations for broader adoption.

In short, WinServerOps Studio transforms our server management from manual and fragmented to automated and intelligent.

Thank you.
